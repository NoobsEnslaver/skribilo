Title: Demonstrating Skribilo's Outline Syntax
Author: Ludovic Courtès
Keywords: Skribilo outline Emacs

This document aims to *demonstrate*
[[http://skribilo.nongnu.org/][Skribilo]]'s outline syntax.


* The First Chapter

The first chapter contains a couple of sections.
They look as though they had been introduced with
the `section' markup of the Skribe syntax.

** The First Section

This section is pretty much empty.

** The Second Section

This section introduces lists.

*** Bullet Lists

This section contains a wonderful `itemize'-style bullet list:

  - the first item;

  - the second item;

  - the last one, which spans
    two lines of text.


And that's it.  Note that list items had to be
separated by empty lines.

*** Enumerations

This section shows an `enumerate'-style list:

  1. The first item;

  2. The second one;

  3. The last one.


Note that list items are numbered this time.


* The Second Chapter

The second chapter does _not_ add anything useful.

Text like this that starts after an empty line is
put into a new paragraph.
