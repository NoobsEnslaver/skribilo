   (p [Skribilo comes with an equation formatting package.  This package
may be loaded by adding the following form at the top of your document:]

	(disp (prog (source :language scheme
		       [(use-modules (skribilo package eq))])))
	
      [It allows the inclusion of (complex) equations in your documents,
such as, for example, the following:]
	
	(disp (eq :renderer (if (engine-format? "html") 'lout #f)
                  :ident "eq-disponibilite"
		  `(= (apply A D)
		      (sum :from (= i b) :to (* S b)
			   (* (script :sup (* S b) :sub i C)
			      (* (expt mu i)
				 (expt (- 1 mu)
				       (- (* S b) i))))))))

describe equations, as well as the rendering options.])

much like any other kind of markup.  However, the resulting syntax
is very verbose and hard to read.])

much simpler syntax.  ]

unlike in the previous example, the equation itself if ,(emph [quoted]),

to a symbol (such as the Greek letter ,(symbol "phi")), you no longer
need to use the ,(tt [symbol]) markup (,(numref :text [see Section]
:ident "symbols")).])

it may adjust various parameters such as in-equation spacing
accordingly.])
