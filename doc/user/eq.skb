(chapter :title [Equation Formatting]
   
   (p [Skribilo comes with an equation formatting package.  This package
may be loaded by adding the following form at the top of your document:]

	(disp (prog (source :language scheme
		       [(use-modules (skribilo package eq))])))
	
      [It allows the inclusion of (complex) equations in your documents,
such as, for example, the following:]
	
	(disp (eq :renderer (if (engine-format? "html") 'lout #f)
                  :ident "eq-disponibilite"
		  `(= (apply A D)
		      (sum :from (= i b) :to (* S b)
			   (* (script :sup (* S b) :sub i C)
			      (* (expt mu i)
				 (expt (- 1 mu)
				       (- (* S b) i))))))))
	
      [This chapter will describe the syntactic facilities available to
describe equations, as well as the rendering options.])
   
   (section :title [Syntax]
      
      (p [To start with, let's have a look at a concrete example. ]
	
        (example-produce
	  (example :legend "Example of a simple equation using the verbose syntax"
	     (prgm :file "src/eq1.skb"))
	  (disp (include "src/eq1.skb")))

  	[In this example, the ,(tt [eq:]) sub-markups are used pretty
much like any other kind of markup.  However, the resulting syntax
is very verbose and hard to read.])
      
      (p [Fortunately, the ,(tt [eq]) package allows for the use of a
much simple syntax.  ]

	(example-produce
	  (example :legend "Example of a simple equation"
	     (prgm :file "src/eq2.skb"))
	  (disp (include "src/eq2.skb")))
	
	[Readers familiar with the Lisp family of programming languages
may have already recognized its ,(emph [prefix notation]).  Note that,
unlike in the previous example, the equation itself if ,(emph [quoted]),
that is, preceded by the ,(tt [']) sign.  Additionally, when referring
to a symbol (such as the Greek letter ,(symbol "phi")), you no longer
need to use the ,(tt [symbol]) markup (,(ref :text [see subsection]
:subsection "Symbols")).]))
