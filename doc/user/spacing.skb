   (p [By default, the spacing rules are the same as those of TeX/LaTeX,
for instance: subsequent white spaces in the input text are coalesced
into a single space in the output.  Language-dependent spacing rules
(e.g., for punctuation) are to be handled by the engine.  This frees you
from having to remember all the spacing details.])

unbreakable and breakable space, respectively:])
