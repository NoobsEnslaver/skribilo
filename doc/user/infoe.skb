   (p [The ,(tt [info]) engine produces GNU,(~)Info files for on-line
browsing with GNU,(~)Emacs or with the stand-alone Info reader of ,(ref
:text [GNU,(~)Texinfo] :url "http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/").])
   
   (p [For each ,(markup-ref "chapter"), ,(markup-ref "section"), etc.,
an Info node is created, whose name is inferred from the ,(param :title)
option.  However, Info node names have to be unique, which the ,(param
:title) options are not necessarily.  Thus, the Info engine does two
things:

,(enumerate
    (item [It warns you about duplicate Info node titles.])
    (item [It allows you to choose a different node name to avoid
conflicts, using the ,(param :info-node) option of ,(markup-ref
"chapter"), etc.]))

Most markups shown in ,(numref :text [Chapter] :ident "std-markups") are
meaningfully rendered in Info, including tables.  However, since Info is
a text-only format, markups such as ,(markup-ref "image") do not yield a
graphical output as with other engines.]))
