* New in Skribilo 0.9.5

** Skribilo now runs on Guile 3.0 (in addition to 2.x)
** Guile 1.8 is no longer supported

** ‘document’ markup supports :info-dir-category and :info-dir-entry

These are honored by the Info engine, which uses them as the category
and entry that show up in the Info “dir” file.

** Info engine: number sections and chapters
** Lout engine: recognize and replace more Unicode characters in the input

* New in Skribilo 0.9.4

** Skribilo now runs on Guile 2.2 (in addition to 2.0 and 1.8)
** HTML engine: do not emit <strong> and <big>

It used to do so for titles and slide titles, which interfered with CSS
customization in addition to being so 1990.

** New style for the HTML user manual, rely on CSS

Items such as markup documentation are now rendered as CSS.  The whole
web site and user manual style has been overhauled thanks to Amirouche
Boubekki.

** Improved Lout style of the user manual
** acmproc: "References" chapter is now unnumbered
** New Friulian and Brazilian Portuguese translations

* New in Skribilo 0.9.3

** Skribilo now speaks your native language

Translations are currently available in Danish, French, Hungarian, and
Swedish.  See <https://translationproject.org/domain/skribilo.html>.
Note that the locale also affects the language used in bibliography
entries and similar.

** HTML engine: all the footnotes are emitted for single-file documents

Previously, only the footnotes of the last chapter or section would be
output.

** HTML engine: each footnote is enclosed in <div class="footnote">

Previously, each footnote was surrounded by <br> and </br>.  The above
change should make CSS customization easier.

** HTML engine: footnote HTML is now valid

It used to be that footnote HTML code contained an extraneous </div>,
and nested <a> tags, which is invalid.

** LaTeX engine: paragraphs no longer systematically preceded by \noindent
** acmproc: fix typos in the LaTeX engine customs
** acmproc: `references' uses a chapter, the default font, and sorts entries
** lncs: style of bibliography entries more closely matches LNCS style.
** `ref' warnings now always print the location of erroneous `:bib' references
** `numref' inserts an unbreakable space (was a breakable space) after its `:text'

* New in Skribilo 0.9.2

** Skribilo is now distributed under GPLv3 or later

Previous versions were under of GPLv2 or later.

** Improved configure-time diagnostics
** `skribilo' now displays a call stack trace upon error when possible
** `skribilo' now installs the user-specified locale
** New `--custom' compiler option
** Using `(image :url ...)' with `lout' yields a warning, not an error
** New `rss-2' input syntax, for RSS 2.0 feeds
** New Info engine, to produce `.info' files browseable with Emacs
** New `:info-node' option for `chapter', `section', etc.
** HTML engine: footnotes now yield hyperlinks back to the call site
** HTML engine: footnotes are properly printed for same-file chapters

Previously, footnotes would not get printed in the case of chapters that
are not output in a separate file.

** HTML engine: use ". " as the default chapter number-title separator
** HTML engine: the `charset' custom changes the output encoding (on Guile 2.0)
** Lout/LaTeX engine: new `encoding' custom
** Lout engine: `lout-illustration' calls the `inline-definitions-proc' custom
** Improved rendering of pie charts with Ploticus
** On Guile 2.0, modules are compiled and `.go' files are installed
** Improve internationalization of informative and error messages
** New test suite (run "make check")
** Various documentation fixes, improvements, and additions

* New in Skribilo 0.9.1

** Improved `configure' diagnostics and build/installation fixes

Thanks to Barrie Stott!

** Various documentation fixes, improvements and additions

Notably, examples no longer use the legacy Skribe API and the ConTeXt
engine is now documented.

** Emacs mode no longer depends on Bigloo UDE
** Guile warnings about duplicate bindings are now hidden

These harmless warnings looked like:

  WARNING: (skribilo ast): imported module (srfi srfi-34) overrides core binding `raise'

** The `slide' package supports additional customs

Namely, `slide-outline-title' and
`slide-outline-{active,inactive}-color'.  See manual for details.

** The `:toc' option of `slide' determines whether to include it in the outline
** New option `:rulecolor' for `table'
** New `--sui-path' command-line option, new `*sui-path*' parameter
** Fix SUI `:ident' references
** Use more SRFI-34/35 exception handling instead of `skribe-error'
** Lesser reliance on recursive make


* New in Skribilo 0.9.0 (user-visible changes compared to Skribe 1.2d)

** New engine: `lout' (see http://lout.sf.net/).

** New packages

  - `eq' for equation formatting.
  - `pie' for pie charts.
  - `diff' for document diff (experimental).
  - `web-book2' for on-line publishing.

** New markups in the `base' package

  `~', `breakable-space', `numref', `!lout', `lout-illustration'.

** Extended markups in the `base' package

   - `footnote' now takes a `:label' option.
   - `document' now takes a `:keywords' option.	
   - `bibliography' now takes a `:labels' option.

** New `outline' front-end (see the `--reader' option of `skribilo')

** New module system (actually that of GNU Guile), no `skribe-load'

  Just like modules help structure programs, they are useful for
  documents: Skribilo documents are not second-class programs.  Also,
  by default, Skribilo documents have fewer bindings in their name
  space than Skribe documents.

  For compatibility with Skribe, see the `--compat=skribe'
  command-line option.

** Little or no global state

  Per-document data structures (e.g., per-document node identifier
  hash table) or SRFI-39 parameters (e.g., `*document-path*') are used
  where appropriate, which introduces API changes.

  Use `--compat=skribe' for compatibility with Skribe.

** Stricter document structure

  In Skribe, if the engine allowed it, it was possible to use
  `section' instead of `chapter' as the top-level section type.  The
  `latex' engine, consequently, has a new custom named
  `class-has-chapters?'.

** Unique node identifiers

  No two nodes within a document can have the same identifier (`:ident'
  parameter).  Duplicate identifiers are reported as an error.

** Bug fixes

  Most notably in the `resolve' subsystem.

** New build system

** Last but not least: New name!  :-)
