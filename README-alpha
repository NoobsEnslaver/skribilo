Please note that this is an "alpha" release, meaning that (i) there are
some glitches here and there, (ii) the API is still subject to change,
and (iii) documentation may be incomplete or inaccurate.

Obvious glitches include limited support or lack thereof of all engines
for some markups or packages.  API changes may include removal of legacy
Skribe procedure (e.g., those exported by `(skribilo lib)'), better
error condition handling, etc.

Nonetheless, this release is hopefully not too far away from a "stable"
release, so keep hope!
