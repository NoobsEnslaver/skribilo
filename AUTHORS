Erick Gallesio and Manuel Serrano implemented Skribe,
http://www.inria.fr/mimosa/fp/Skribe .

Skribilo is based upon Skribe 1.2d and re-uses a large body of code
written for Skribe by Erick and Manuel, and in particular mostly code
by Erick from the STkLos implementation.  The port to GNU Guile and
several enhancements were implemented by Ludovic Courtès.
