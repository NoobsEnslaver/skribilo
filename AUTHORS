Érick Gallesio and Manuel Serrano implemented Skribe,
http://www.inria.fr/mimosa/fp/Skribe/ .

Skribilo is based upon Skribe 1.2d and re-uses a large body of code by
Érick and Manuel, in particular code by Érick from the STkLos
implementation.

The port to GNU Guile and several enhancements were implemented by
Ludovic Courtès <ludo@gnu.org>.
