Skribilo
========

Skribilo is a document authoring system allowing users to produce
documents in a variety of formats (HTML, PostScript, PDF, XML, etc.)
from a single source document, while still retaining fine-grain control
over the output.

Beside rudimentary features provided by the `base' package, Skribilo
provides packages for the production of colored program source code,
bibliographies, pie charts, mathematical equations, and more.

Skribilo is based on the Scheme programming language and is highly
extensible: it is easy to define new documentation primitives (called
"markups") and their rendering in each output format.

Skribilo's core is written in mostly-portable Scheme (i.e., uses
standard APIs such as SRFIs rather than Guile-specific APIs whenever
that is possible), making it intelligible and hackable for most Scheme
programmers.

Requirements
............

You need at least:

  * GNU Guile >= 1.8.x
    http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/

  * Guile-Reader >= 0.3
    http://www.nongnu.org/guile-reader/

  * Guile-Lib (unless using Guile >= 1.8.3)
    http://home.gna.org/guile-lib/

Optionally, you may want to install one of the following document layout
programs to produce PS/PDF files:

  * Lout
    http://lout.sourceforge.net/

  * LaTeX
    http://www.latex-project.org/

  * ConTeXt
    http://www.pragma-ade.nl/

Optionally, to produce pie charts, you may want to use:

  * Ploticus
    http://ploticus.sourceforge.net/

This is it!


Development
...........

A copy of the source code repository can be obtained with Git
(http://git.or.cz/), using the following incantation:

  git-clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/skribilo.git

You can then send patches to the <skribilo-users@nongnu.org> mailing
list!


History
.......

Skribilo is based on the Skribe code base, written by Manuel Serrano and
Erick Gallesio.  See `README.Skribe' for the original Skribe `README'
file, or visit:

I am thankful to them for implementing Skribe!
