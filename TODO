* Important Items (Release Blockers)

** Have both a Skribe compat module and a "native"
In `(skribilo module)', it should be possible to create either a Skribe
compatibility module that pulls all the compatibility bindings, or a
Skribilo "native" module, with fewer bindings.  This should translate
into a `--compat=XXX' command-line option.

** Update the documentation, remove Skribe legacy stuff
** Have a PS/PDF version of the documentation (preferably using Lout)
** Remove calls to `skribe-error', use SRFI-35 exceptions
** Fix the HTML engine for `html-left-margin'
Left margin doesn't display well when CSS is being used.


* Small Items, Known Bugs

** `eq' package: Handle `:number' in the HTML back-end


* Longer-Term Items

** Add a `if-engine' markup to avoid hacks with `engine-format?'
Expressions like `(if (engine-format? "lout") xxx yyy)' are wrong,
because they look at the value of `*current-engine*' rather than the
engine actually used during resolution and output.

** Write an Info engine based on Scribe's one
** Write an XHTML engine
** Write a nice GUI based on Andy's STexi browser
** Render equations using MathML when rendering to HTML
** Add stand-alone tools
Such as `skribilo-to-bibtex', `bibtex-to-skribilo', etc.
** Provide better internationalization
