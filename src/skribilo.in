# The `skribilo' executable.

# Note: In Guile 1.8+ (or 1.9), when Guile is run in batch mode with
# `--debug', it produces a clean stack trace when an exception is
# raised and uncaught.  On earlier versions, it behaves as if
# `--debug' had not been passed, not displaying a stack trace.  See
# http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-devel/2006-01/msg00022.html
# for details.
#
# In any case, don't pass `--debug' by default (for performance
# reason).  When needed, the use should explicitly set the `GUILE'
# environment variable to, e.g., "guile --debug".
